            A. Yes
            B. No
            C. Not sure

Answer:
A

The answer is A because the movie is described as "very good" with positive mentions of acting and performances, but also states that it's not as good as other movies. This indicates that while it's good, there are other movies that might be even better. Therefore, the correct choice is A.

            What is AGENTIC AI

            Answer: 
            AGENTIC AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act independently, make decisions, and take actions on their own without constant human supervision. Unlike traditional AI models that primarily process data and provide outputs based on predefined tasks, agentic AI has the ability to observe its environment, set goals, plan steps to achieve those goals, and execute actions—such as interacting with users or controlling devices—based on real-time feedback. This autonomy enables it to adapt dynamically to changing conditions and solve complex problems more effectively by reasoning through multiple possibilities and making choices autonomously. It represents a significant evolution from reactive AI toward more intelligent, self-directed agents capable

            Answer: 
            Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act independently, make decisions, and take actions on their own without constant human supervision. Unlike traditional AI models that primarily respond to inputs or perform tasks based on predefined instructions, agentic AI has autonomy, goal-directed behavior, and the ability to plan, reason, and adapt its actions over time. These systems can observe their environment, set objectives, generate plans, execute steps, and evaluate outcomes—similar to how humans make decisions. They are designed to operate continuously and dynamically, often using self-improvement mechanisms to refine performance. Examples include AI agents that manage personal schedules, negotiate
